This organisation was created by me to organise the growing number of repositories I had to manage.

Here I have documented the code I wrote for labs @ KIIT (not all of them were maintained with equal amounts of love!)

- Object Oriented Programming in Java
- Basic C Programming
- Data Structures in C
- Computer Networks in C
- Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- Application Development Lab
- Artificial Intelligence Lab
